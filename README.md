# Signals Shop
## Project Overview

The application has an inventory of signal-related "fictional" products. 
You can search through the inventory and add items to the cart, modify the quantities of each 
item in the cart and checkout the cart.
The application keeps your cart state stored in the local storage, so you can continue from where you left off.
